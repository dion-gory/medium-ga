# Genetic Algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This project implements a genetic algorithm to approximate a solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python 3.12.

---

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

- **City Generation:** Creates 20 cities (including a depot at the centre).
- **Route Evaluation:** Computes the total distance of a TSP route using Euclidean distance.
- **Genetic Operators:** Implements tournament selection, order crossover, and swap mutation to evolve routes.
- **Visualisation:** Plots the best route every 10 generations and saves the images.
- **Performance Tracking:** Records the best route cost over generations and generates a graph.
- **GIF Creation:** Combines saved frames into a GIF to visualise the evolution of the TSP solution.
